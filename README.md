## Prototype UI TODO for First Iteration
1. add icons to nodes
2. style labels with dropshadows and add change label tool
3. add hide/unhide subtree
4. push node away from parent if it gets too close
5. change zoom to mousewheel instead of keys

## Notes
- A production app like this should probably use WebGL instead of SVGs
- The graph rotates around its upper left instead of its centre (no point fixing because it won't affect a WebGL version)
